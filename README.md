I build tools. Most of what I make starts as a personal problem I got tired of working around,<br/>
and at some point it felt wrong to keep it private. So here we are.<br/><br/>
I started as a music producer and ended up writing more code than playing chords.<br/>
Somewhere along the way the two got tangled together and I never really untangled them.<br/>
I now build tools for producers, scripts that poke at the internet,<br/>
and utilities that should have existed already but somehow didn't.<br/><br/>
I don't have a brand. I don't have a niche. I don't have a LinkedIn.<br/>
I see something missing, find it annoying enough, build it, and put it here.<br/>
In case someone else finds it useful. Or at least entertaining.<br/><br/>
I stay anonymous. The work speaks for itself.<br/>
(the work also has a terrible commit history but let's not talk about that)

[![Sample Pack Assembler](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sample%20Pack%20Assembler-%E2%86%92%20View%20Project-1a1a1a?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=c8b89a&labelColor=111111)](https://github.com/strykey/Sample-Pack-Assembler)

A desktop app for producers who are tired of folders named `samples_FINAL_v3_USE_THIS`.<br/>
You drop in a chaotic directory of kicks, snares, loops and synths and it comes out the other side<br/>
sorted into 14 categories, renamed with a template you define, and ready to distribute or sell.<br/>
Five distinct visual themes, audio preview on hover, one Python file, one dependency.<br/>
I spent more time on the themes than on the actual logic. Worth it.

<br/>

[![Pixora](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pixora-%E2%86%92%20View%20Project-1a1a1a?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=c8b89a&labelColor=111111)](https://github.com/strykey/Pixora)

Drop any image, get real pixel art back.<br/>
Not a filter, not a "make it look pixelated" button.<br/>
Actual perceptual color quantization, Floyd-Steinberg dithering, smart auto pixel sizing.<br/>
It reads the content of the image before deciding on a resolution, which sounds obvious<br/>
and yet nobody else seemed to bother doing it.<br/>
No account, no upload, no waiting. Runs on your machine. Done.

<br/>

[![IRIS](https://img.shields.io/badge/IRIS-%E2%86%92%20View%20Project-1a1a1a?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=c8b89a&labelColor=111111)](https://github.com/strykey/IRIS)

A multithreaded reconnaissance tool that scans random public IPs and surfaces exposed devices in real time.<br/>
Cameras, routers, admin panels, live streams, forgotten websites sitting wide open.<br/>
IRIS sends plain HTTP requests at scale and classifies what comes back using 57 device signatures.<br/>
People talk about the deep web like it requires Tor and a mystery password.<br/>
The reality is that the most interesting stuff is just sitting on the regular internet,<br/>
completely public, waiting for someone to look. IRIS looks.

Discord added quests that require you to play specific games to earn rewards.<br/>
The games weigh anywhere from 30GB to 500GB.<br/>
The reward is a small decorative orb on your Discord profile.<br/>
OrbsHacker fakes the game processes so Discord thinks you are playing without installing anything.<br/>
It is completely stupid, it took me a weekend, it works perfectly,<br/>
and I consider it one of my finest achievements as a developer.
