I build tools. Most of what I make starts as a personal problem<br/>
I got tired of working around, and at some point it felt wrong to keep it private.<br/><br/>
I started as a music producer and ended up writing more code than playing chords.<br/>
Somewhere along the way the two got tangled together, and now most of what I build<br/>
lives somewhere in between: tools for producers, scripts that poke at the internet,<br/>
converters and utilities that should have existed already and somehow didn't.<br/><br/>
I don't have a brand. I don't have a niche. I just see something missing, find it annoying<br/>
enough, and build it. Then I put it here in case someone else finds it useful.<br/><br/>
I stay anonymous. The work speaks for itself.

[![Sample Pack Assembler](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sample%20Pack%20Assembler-%E2%86%92%20View%20Project-1a1a1a?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=c8b89a&labelColor=111111)](https://github.com/strykey/Sample-Pack-Assembler)

A desktop app for producers who are tired of folders named `samples_FINAL_v3_USE_THIS`.<br/>
You drop in a chaotic directory of kicks, snares, loops and synths and it comes out the other side<br/>
sorted into 14 categories, renamed with a template you define, and ready to distribute or sell.<br/>
Five distinct visual themes — Noir, Vapor, Acid, Studio, Lo-Fi — each with its own font pairing.<br/>
Audio preview on hover, bulk assignment, one Python file, one dependency. That's the whole thing.

<br/>

[![Pixora](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pixora-%E2%86%92%20View%20Project-1a1a1a?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=c8b89a&labelColor=111111)](https://github.com/strykey/Pixora)

Drop any image, get real pixel art back.<br/>
Not a filter, not a blur effect. Actual perceptual color quantization, Floyd-Steinberg dithering<br/>
and smart auto pixel sizing that reads the content of the image before deciding on a resolution.<br/>
Edge enhancement keeps the result sharp and readable even at small pixel sizes.<br/>
No account, no upload to a server somewhere, no waiting. It runs on your machine, instantly.

<br/>

[![IRIS](https://img.shields.io/badge/IRIS-%E2%86%92%20View%20Project-1a1a1a?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=c8b89a&labelColor=111111)](https://github.com/strykey/IRIS)

A multithreaded reconnaissance tool that scans random public IPs and surfaces exposed devices in real time.<br/>
Cameras, routers, admin panels, live video streams, forgotten websites sitting wide open on the internet.<br/>
IRIS sends plain HTTP requests at scale and classifies what comes back using a database of 57 signatures.<br/>
Every hit is saved automatically. The internet is bigger and stranger than what Google shows you.<br/>
IRIS finds what is just sitting there in plain sight, waiting for someone to look.

<br/>

[![OrbsHacker](https://img.shields.io/badge/OrbsHacker-%E2%86%92%20View%20Project-1a1a1a?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=c8b89a&labelColor=111111)](https://github.com/strykey/orbshacker)

Discord added Orb quests that require you to play specific games to earn rewards.<br/>
The games weigh anywhere from 30GB to 500GB. The reward is a cosmetic orb on Discord.<br/>
OrbsHacker fakes the game processes so Discord thinks you are playing without installing anything.<br/>
It is completely stupid, it took me a weekend, and it works perfectly.<br/>
No regrets whatsoever.
